## Principles of Analytic Graphics 

* Show comparisons
  
  When showing a graph it is always better to show comparison against 
  a controlled environment to have it be better visually interpreted 
  what the objective of the plotted data is.
  
  eg: Introducing air purifier in homes with children who suffer from 
  asthma, we plot the data of number of days children were symptom-free 
  when air purifier was introduced. The control group comprises of data 
  on children who did not have air purifiers.
  
* Show causuality, or mechanisms

  Aids in visually interpreting the outcome of the experiment or why 
  a particular event occured in the experiment, what changes to other 
  elements in the environment did it bring to support the outcome.
  
  eg: Introducing air purifier in homes with children who suffer from 
  asthma, with a control group having no air purifier. We would like to 
  know what caused the difference in the plots of the two groups. Thus 
  we observe changes to levels of PM2.5 in the atmosphere for both the 
  groups.

* Show multivariate data 

  To show correlation and integrated comparison between the distribution 
  of a variable with respect to one or more other variables 
  
  eg: Relation between PM2.5 level and the number of days children with 
  asthma do not exhibit symptoms 

* Integrate evidence 
  
  Integrate evidence and data to support the hypothesis, also the data to 
  explain the plot and how the different components are related and support 
  the hypothesis. completely integrate works, images, numbers and diagrams 
  using the flexible tools that can be used in R. Don't let the tools drive
  the analyis instead perform the analysis by incorporating various tools 
  and integrating them in the final output. it must be easily interpretible 
  and make sense just by looking without having to look paste the graphic 
  into documentations or other descriptions 
  
* Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, 
  and sources etc.
  
  Data graphic should tell the complete story that is credible, by properly 
  documenting the source and having the source code available, along with 
  information on what actions were performed on the data, enables others to 
  reproduce the data. 

* Content is king
  
  Without good content there isn't much that can be done to make an interesting 
  enough graphic.
