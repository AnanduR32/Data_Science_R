# Basics

## Using xyplot to create a scatter plot Ozone vs Wind 

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(lattice)
airquality = transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
xyplot(Ozone~Wind, data = airquality)
```  


## Using xyplot to create separate scatter plots of Ozone vs Wind for each month

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(lattice)
airquality = transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
xyplot(Ozone~Wind | Month, data = airquality, layout = c(5,1))
```
