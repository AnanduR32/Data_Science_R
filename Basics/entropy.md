# Entropy 

* It is a measure of homogeneity of the set of examples 

* Given a set S of positive and negative examples of some target concept (a two class problem) the entropy of set S relative to this binary classification is 
    ```
    E(S) = - plogp - (1-p)log(1-p)
    ```
* Entropy is ideally supposed to be 1, which signifies perfect split of the data (halved).
