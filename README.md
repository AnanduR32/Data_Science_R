Data Science Basics in R

## Datascience Analysis Categories 
* ### Descriptive analysis

    When it is only necessary to describe the data without drawing any conclusion or relation between the variables. Descriptive analysis will generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements. Some common descriptives statistics are measures of central tendency (eg: mean, median, mode) or measures of variability (eg: range, standard deviations or variance).
    
* ### Exploratory analysis

    We look at relations and obtain new findings and correlation between objects. But always remember the rule of thumb "Correlation does not imply causation", which implores that it is not necessary that just because there is a correlation one is not the cause of the other. Using exploratory analysis we find useful relations that were previously not known to us. 
    
* ### Inferential analysis 

    We observe how the analysis drawn from a sample group is related or similar to the population as a whole. Inferential analysis is commonly the goal of statistical modelling, where you have a small amount of information to extrapolate and generalize that information to a larger group.
    
* ### Predictive analysis 

    In predictive analysis we look at the data at hand and try make predictions about future data. The accuracy of the predictions is depended on measuring the right variables.

* ### Causal analysis

   the goal of causal analysis is to see what happens to one variable when we manipulate another variable - looking at the cause and effect of a relationship. Causal analyses are applied to the results of randomized studies that were designed to identify causation

* ### Mechanistic analysis

  It is a rather uncommon technique mostly applied in field of material science experiments, where there is deterministic outcome that can be analysed by modelling a deterministic equation and feeding it the right data. 
  
## Experimental Analysis 
* ### The main preliminary steps involved in experimental analysis are :

  * formulation of question
  * Designing of experiment
  * Identification of problems and sources of errors 
  * Collecting data

* ### Principles of experimental analysis:

  * #### Independent variable (factor):
  
      The data that is manipulated to obtain the desired measurement, and inpdepentent of other parameters 
      
  * #### Dependent variable:
      
      The measurement that is to be obtained as a result of analyzing the independent data
   
  * #### Hypothesis:
  
      The formed suggestion about a particular subject, or it can be considered as the expected outcome of the experiment that is being performed, the primary aspect of any data science analysis is to prove whether a hypothesis is true or not.
      
  * #### Cofounder: 
  
      An extraneous variable that may affect the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. When a correlation is found between independent variables and dependent variable it is important to be on the lookout for any cofounders that might be the actual variable missed out from the experiment that *cofounds* the findings your experiment and is the actual *cause* for the observed outcome. Often we use **Control** set to monitor the experiment the control and the experimentation set have different parameters to observe the effect of different variable on the outcome. This helps to identify cofounders and eliminate unnecessary variables. 
      
  * #### Randomization:
  
      The "balancing" of confounders is achieved by randomization, it is often seen in the random assignment of sample objects to control group and the experimentation group.
      
  * #### Replication: 
  
      The repetition of the experiment a number of times to arrive at a similar outcomes signifies that the model developed and the outcome obtained is strong. It helps to measure the **variability** within the experiment.
  
  * #### p-value :
  
      It is the measure of the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis provided by the sample data. This is a value that tells you the probability that the results of your experiment were observed by chance, i.e. It is a probability that is calculated on the pretext that the null hypothesis is true, therefore a very low value suggest a strong statistical model.
  
## Data Quality Dimensions 
* ##### Completeness 
* ##### Validity 
* ##### Accuracy
* ##### Consistency 
* ##### Integrity
* ##### Timeliness
